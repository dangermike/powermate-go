# PowerMate

This is my VERY incomplete attempt at writing a thing to make my [Griffin PowerMate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin_PowerMate) do stuff. I know that there are already applications out there for this, but I don't care. I'm doing this for fun and have no expectations that this is something anyone is going to want. Not even me.

Play/pause and volume, the things I want most, are apparently hard to get with old-fashioned send-keys stuff on the Mac, so I'm targeting Linux for now. Maybe I'll toughen up and take another swing at the Mac version later. I was thinking that it might be fun to make some kind of mark-copy-paste thing like [Stackoverflow's _The Key_](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/03/31/the-key-copy-paste/).

The product development team here at Dangermike Industries is working hard on this one.
